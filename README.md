# I intalled pyglet=1.5.11,gym=0.21.0,gym-retro,ipykernel

**note** to work with vscode, I created conda env with python=3.8, installed ipykernel, then downgraded to python=3.7. The reason for this is that python notebook is incompatible with vscode if Python=3.7, but gym-retro only works with python<=3.7

Leaving this here for potentially playing against AI later

Adding states:

Followed this nearly directly - necessary to use Windows UI Integration, replace cores, use the same ROM for states and gym-retro
